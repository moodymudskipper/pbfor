\title{Use a progress bar with regular for loops}
\usage{
pb_for(format = "[:bar] :percent", width = options("width")[[1]] - 2,
  complete = "=", incomplete = "-", current = ">",
  callback = invisible, clear = TRUE, show_after = 0.2,
  force = FALSE, message = NULL, tokens = alist(), once = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{The format of the progress bar. A number of tokens can be used
here, see them below. It defaults to "\link{:bar} :percent", which means that
the progress bar is within brackets on the left, and the percentage is
printed on the right.}

\item{width}{Width of the progress bar.}

\item{complete}{Completion character.}

\item{incomplete}{Incomplete character.}

\item{current}{Current character.}

\item{callback}{Callback function to call when the progress bar finishes.
The progress bar object itself is passed to it as the single parameter.}

\item{clear}{Whether to clear the progress bar on completion.}

\item{show_after}{Amount of time in seconds, after which the progress bar is
shown on the screen. For very short processes, it is probably not worth
showing it at all.}

\item{force}{Whether to force showing the progress bar, even if the given (or default) stream does not seem to support it.}

\item{message}{A message to display on top of the bar}

\item{tokens}{A list of unevaluated expressions, using \code{alist}, to be passed
passed to the \code{tick} method of the progress bar}

\item{once}{Wether to return \code{for} to it's default behavior after it's been
called once.}
}
\description{
A wrapper around the package \emph{progress} to be able to use progress bar with
regular \code{for} loops conveniently. It forwards all its parameters to
\code{progress::progress_bar$new()} except for \code{once}.
}
\examples{
pb_for()
for (i in 1:10) {
  # DO SOMETHING
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}

pb_for(format = "Working hard: [:bar] :percent :elapsed",
       callback = function(x) message("Were'd done!"))
for (i in 1:10) {
  # DO SOMETHING
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}
}
